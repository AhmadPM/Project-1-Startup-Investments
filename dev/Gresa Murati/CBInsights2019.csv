Their award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and their project will address further development and commercialization of a multi-enzyme lead optimization chip (Multizyme Chip) for high-throughput generation of lead compound analogs coupled with cell-based screening for the rapid identification of biologically active derivatives. Such a capability directly impacts a key bottleneck in drug discovery; namely, the efficient optimization of lead compounds to develop drugs with optimal pharmacological properties. Solidus Biosciences, Inc. proposes to combine six biocatalysis with pharmacological screening to provide rapid identification of biologically active compounds against cell-specific targets, which is a new paradigm for lead optimization. Moreover, the Multizyme Chip platform will be well-suited for lead optimization in related industries, including agrochemicals, cosmetics, and cosmeceuticals. The Solidus technology will thus improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and chemical industries, and will serve as a rich source of new and improved commercial products. The broader impacts of this research are the advances that Solidus Biosciences will achieve toward generating better and safer drugs, reducing the cost to develop these drugs, and increasing the overall efficiency of the pharmaceutical industry. Solidus will generate Multizyme Chips for purchase by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to facilitate their lead optimization programs, particularly those involving natural product-derived and complex synthetic small molecule leads. Cryopreservation techniques developed in Phase II will enable the sale of chips and chip-handling devices produced during Phase I, and will allow seamless penetration of the Solidus technology platform into the company's target markets.   Solidus Biosciences is a company that received a STTR Phase I grant for a project entitled: Development of a Lead Optimization Chip for Drug Discovery. Their research project aims to develop a new method for generating lead compounds by using enzymatic modification of compound sets. Availability of new methodology to generate biologically active compounds from existing molecules may enhance the success of the drug discovery process and may lead to the discovery of new and useful therapeutics.   Solidus Biosciences is a company that received a STTR Phase I grant for a project entitled: High-Throughput RNAi Screening of Mammalian Cells. Their research project aims to develop a system for the rapid screening of siRNAs that can inhibit genes involved in cellular responses such as hyperosmotic stress that can affect pathways of high commercial importance, including protein production. Use of hyperosmotic stress as a proof of concept system will demonstrate the feasibility of high-throughput RNAi screening and will at the same time yield results that can be used to improve monoclonal antibody production in commercial and laboratory settings Production of biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies is exquisitely responsive to the culture conditions under which the cells are grown and thus can be improved through optimizing such settings, which in turn, would affect the genes involved in the specific synthetic pathways of interest. Development of a rapid methodology to identify inhibitory RNA molecules that can inhibit genes that adversely affect yield would be of significant importance to pharmaceutical companies that produce protein therapeutics and may result in a lowering of the const of these therapeutic entities.",National Science Foundation;Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute;Samsung Ventures,0.8,Healthcare,Drug Development,,United States,New York,Troy,(518) 276-2811,,,,,,,,,,,,,Grant,8/14/09,0.5,Grant,National Science Foundation,,,,,North America,,Pharma Startups;Cancer Therapeutics,0,0,,4,0,0.24,0.00%,,@solidusbio,,,,Soozy's,http://www.soozysgrainfree.com,"Soozy's offers a line of grain-free, gluten-free frozen muffins that are sold in over 500 retailers, including HEB and Wegmans.",AccelFoods;Boulder Investment Group Reprise,2.5,Food & Beverages,Canned and frozen foods,,United States,New York,New York,,hello@soozys.com,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,Seed VC,6/6/18,2.5,Seed VC,AccelFoods;Boulder Investment Group Reprise,,,,,North America,,Consumer Packaged Goods ( CPG );Food & Beverage ,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,Sophie's Kitchen,http://www.sophieskitchen.com,Sophie's Kitchen makes plant-based seafood alternatives.,Chipotle Aluminaries Project;Nutrition Greenhouse;Slingshot@Switch,0.17,Food & Beverages,"Meat, Fish, Seafood & Alternative Proteins",,United States,California,Sebastopol,877-464-0732,,,,,,,,,,,,,Incubator/Accelerator - II,1/28/19,,Incubator,Chipotle Aluminaries Project,,,,,North America,,Alternative Proteins Startups;Wellness Tech,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,Sotera Wireless,http://www.soterawireless.com,"Sotera Wireless, fka Triage Wireless, is a medical device company dedicated to the development, marketing and sale of vital signs monitoring solutions.
